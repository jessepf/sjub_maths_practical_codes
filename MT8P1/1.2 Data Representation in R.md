### Experiment 1: Part 2 Data Representation using R ###
# Diagramatic Representation of Data #
## Histogram ##
To plot histogram, we use ```hist```. 
```R
  hist(c(1,2,3,4))
  ```
 
To know about more options in ```hist```, use ```?hist```.

<!--- ### Ogive Curves ### --->
## Dot Plots and Scatter Plots ##
For dot plots, use
```R
  plot(trees$Girth)
  ```
For scatter plot with X = trees$Girth and Y = trees$Heights,
```R
  plot(trees$Girth, trees$Heights)
  ```
To know about more options in ```plot```, use ```?plot```.

## Box Plot ##
For box plot,
```R
  boxplot(Girth ~ Height, data = trees)
  ```
  
## Stem and Leaf Radar Plot ##
For step and leaf radar plot, use ```stem(X)```

<!---### Ternary Plot ###--->
## Pie Chart ##
```R
  pie(c(2,3,4))
  ```
## Bar Diagram ##
```R
  barplot(trees$Height)
  ```
