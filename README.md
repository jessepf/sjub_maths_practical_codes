# Mathematics Practical Codes #
Collection of codes to illustrate mathematical concepts with Python/R/SageMath I teach in St. Joseph's University, Bengaluru. Note that even optimized codes may be there, but ones here are chosen to strike a balance between good code and easiness to teach. I have only chosen the codes I wrote, not all experiments. 

Most concepts have multiple codes available for the same output.

All Jupyter notebooks are downloadable. Unless specified, they have Python Kernel.
